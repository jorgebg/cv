  - Trained the teams to set up Datadog dashboards, monitoring alerts, SLAs and error budgets, which allowed them to measure performance and improve the reliability.
  - Migration from in-house infrastructure management system to Terraform and CloudFormation, enabling efficient provisioning and consistent configurations across environments.
- Conducted over a hundred interviews and delivered many talks in tech events, playing a pivotal role in talent acquisition and knowledge dissemination, enriching our team with diverse talents and fostering industry connections.
- Founded and organized the Django Madrid User Group, and Eventbrite sponsored the meetups. This brought more candidates to the hiring pipeline.
